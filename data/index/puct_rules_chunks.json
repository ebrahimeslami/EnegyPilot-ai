A utility must provide inspection reports \nto commission staff within 20 days of staff’s request.\n\n(1) \nThe energy efficiency service provider, or for self-delivered programs, the utility, is responsible for \nthe determination and documentation of energy and peak demand savings using the approved \nevaluation and/or measurement and verification protocol, and may utilize the services of an \nindependent third party for such purposes.\n\n(2) \nCommission-approved deemed energy and peak demand savings may be used in lieu of the energy \nefficiency service provider’s measurement and verification, where applicable. The deemed savings \napproved by the commission before December 31, 2007 are continued in effect, unless superseded \nby commission action.\n\n(3) \nWhere installed measures are employed, an energy efficiency service provider must verify that the \nmeasures contracted for were installed before final payment is made to the energy efficiency service \nprovider, by obtaining the customer’s signature certifying that the measures were installed, or by \nother reasonably reliable means approved by the utility."

A utility must establish an EECRF that complies with this subsection to timely recover the \nreasonable costs of providing a portfolio of cost-effective energy efficiency programs under §25.181 of this \ntitle. Each utility must file its application according to the commission’s file format standards in §22.72 of \nthis title (relating to Formal Requisites of Pleadings and Documents to be Filed with the Commission).\n\n(1) \nThe EECRF must be calculated based on the following:\n\n(A) \nThe utility’s forecasted annual energy efficiency program expenditures, the preceding \nyear’s over- or under-recovery including interest and municipal and utility EECRF \nproceeding expenses, any utility incentive earned under subsection (e) of this section, and \nevaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V) contractor costs allocated to the utility \nby the commission for the preceding year under §25.181 of this title."
