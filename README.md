# PUCT Energy Efficiency Community Portal  
**A RAG-based, community-facing regulatory chatbot for Texas energy efficiency rules**

---

## Overview

This repository provides a **Python-based, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) portal** designed to help community members, advocates, policymakers, and practitioners **understand Texas Public Utility Commission (PUCT) energy efficiency regulations**, with a focus on:

- **16 TAC §25.181 – Energy Efficiency Goal**
- **16 TAC §25.182 – Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery Factor**
- **16 TAC §25.183 – Reporting and Evaluation of Energy Efficiency Programs**

The portal combines:

- **Authoritative regulatory text** (official PUCT rule PDFs),
- **Local utility program context** (CenterPoint Energy public program pages), and
- **A community-friendly chat interface** (Streamlit),

while enforcing **strict regulatory guardrails** to ensure transparency, traceability, and accuracy.

---

## Motivation

PUCT energy efficiency rules are highly technical and difficult for non-specialists to interpret.  
This tool was developed to:

- Improve **public access** to regulatory information,
- Reduce **misinterpretation of energy efficiency requirements**, and
- Demonstrate how **RAG-based AI systems** can be safely applied to regulatory and policy contexts.

The project emphasizes **regulation-first design**, ensuring that explanations remain grounded in official rule text rather than model inference.

---

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Regulation-First (Authoritative Source of Truth)
PUCT rules are treated as the **sole authoritative regulatory source**.  
All regulatory claims must be explicitly supported by retrieved rule text.

### 2. Separation of Regulatory Text and Program Context
The system uses **two independent vector indexes**:

- **PUCT Rules Index**  
  - §§25.181, 25.182, 25.183 (PDFs from the PUCT)  
  - Used for all regulatory explanations and compliance-related statements

- **CenterPoint Program Context Index**  
  - Public utility program pages  
  - Used only for explanatory, non-regulatory context

This separation ensures users can clearly distinguish:  
**What the rule requires** vs **how programs are implemented locally**

### 3. Community-Facing by Design
The portal is designed for non-technical users and includes:

- Plain-language explanations
- Automatic glossary support
- English / Spanish output toggle
- Transparent citations with page references

---

## Features

### Retrieval-Augmented Regulatory Chatbot
- Answers questions using retrieved rule text only
- Provides page-level citations for every regulatory claim
- Refuses to speculate when supporting text is not found

### Regulatory-Only Mode Enforcement
When users select **“PUCT Rules only”**:
- Program logistics questions (rebates, sign-up, eligibility) trigger a warning
- Users are prompted to explicitly enable CenterPoint context if desired

### Citation Quality Check
If an answer includes regulatory language (e.g., “must,” “required,” “PUCT rule”) but lacks a valid PUCT citation:
- The response is rejected
- The user is asked to rephrase or increase retrieval depth

### Built-In Glossary
A curated glossary explains common energy efficiency terms, including:
- kW vs kWh
- EM&V
- EECRF
- Standard Offer Program (SOP)
- Peak demand

Glossary entries appear automatically when relevant.

### Bilingual Output
- English and Spanish responses supported
- Citations remain anchored to English regulatory text (authoritative source)

```

---

## Installation

### 1. Create and activate a virtual environment (Windows example)

```powershell
cd {target folder path}\EnergyPilot_puct-ee-portal
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Build the Indexes

This step:
- Downloads official PUCT PDFs,
- Fetches CenterPoint program pages,
- Chunks, embeds, and indexes content into **separate FAISS indexes**.

```powershell
python ingest_build_indexes.py
```

### SSL / Certificate Note

Some environments (e.g., corporate networks) may block TLS verification when downloading from `ftp.puc.texas.gov`.  
The ingestion script includes a **controlled SSL fallback mechanism** using `certifi`.

As a last resort, users may explicitly allow insecure SSL by setting:

```powershell
set PUCT_ALLOW_INSECURE_SSL=1
```

This behavior is **opt-in** and clearly documented in the code.

---

## Run the Portal

```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the local URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:8501`).

---

## Intended Use Cases

- Community education and outreach
- Energy justice and equity initiatives
- Local government and NGO support tools
- Academic research and reproducibility
- Policy transparency and trust-building
